Westeros braces for a winter which may become a new Long Night, as the White Walkers and their army of the dead are poised to strike against the Wall and the realms of men....	Winter has come. Westeros braces for a winter which may become a new Long Night, as the White Walkers and their army of the dead are poised to strike against the Wall and the realms of men. In King's Landing, Queen Cersei Lannister has been publicly shamed by the Faith of the Seven and awaits her trial for regicide and incest. Even Grand Maester Pycelle has abandoned her, and called her uncle, Ser Kevan Lannister, to rule as the new Hand of the King. Even though Cersei has been released to their custody, her inept leadership nearly destroyed House Lannister's hold on the throne and they have no intention of ever letting her wield power again. Kevan and Pycelle must attempt to mend the damage Cersei did to the Lannister-Tyrell alliance. The Lannisters and Tyrells on Kevan's Small Council maintain a shaky truce as they attempt to deal with the ongoing debt crisis to the Iron Bank of Braavos, as well as the rise of the fanatical Faith Militant due to Cersei's blunders. Cersei meanwhile, though seemingly humbled, still has a few schemes she will attempt to play to regain control. In the North, the Boltons have triumphed over King Stannis - but in the distraction, Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy have escaped, desperately jumping off Winterfell's castle walls. Brienne of Tarth, who executed Stannis, must now deal with the consequences of putting her vow to avenge King Renly before her oath to protect Sansa. In Dorne, Ellaria Sand's poisoning of Cersei's daughter, the Princess Myrcella, may now force Doran Martell into the war against the Iron Throne he has been fervently trying to avoid. Across the Narrow Sea, in the Free City of Braavos, Arya Stark killed Meryn Trant without the Faceless Men's permission - and without the proper training, the use of one of their masks has poisoned her and rendered her blind. Her training continues, as now the blind little girl must learn to rely on her other senses to survive. In Slaver's Bay, Daenerys Targaryen's attempt to liberate Meereen has resulted in massive bloodshed, with the former slave masters conspiring to retake the city. In a large scale ambush on the opening day of the games in Daznak's Pit however, Daenerys climbed onto Drogon's back to try to escape the danger - but she could not make him return to the city. Instead, the young dragon flew north to the southern border of the Dothraki Sea, the lands of his birth, where the stranded Daenerys has been surrounded by a hostile Dothraki khalasar numbering in the thousands. Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis have set out to search for her. Meanwhile, back in the city Daenerys's advisors Tyrion Lannister, Missandei, and Grey Worm are joined by Varys in attempting to hold together rule over the city wrecked by the ongoing insurgency until Daenerys returns - if she returns at all. At the Wall, Lord Commander Jon Snow attempted to prepare for the coming of the White Walkers by letting as many wildlings through to the south as he could - but tens of thousands more were killed and resurrected as undead wights at Hardhome. The leading Night's Watch officers, increasingly upset at Jon's proposed alliance with the wildlings, have staged a mutiny "for the Watch" and stabbed Jon multiple times until he fell. Just before the mutiny against Jon Snow, he sent away Samwell Tarly to go to the Citadel in Oldtown in order to train to be a new maester to replace Maester Aemon after his passing. Samwell takes Gilly and her young son with him, rather than leave them in the path of the White Walkers. Oldtown, Westeros's second largest city, is located in the southwest of the Reach, not far away from Sam's former home, the House Tarly castle-seat at Horn Hill. Samwell and Gilly, however, face a long and difficult sea voyage before they get to the Citadel. Distracted by the political intrigues in King's Landing, the exhausted lords of Westeros must now brace for the rise of the kraken - the ironborn led by House Greyjoy. Early in the War of the Five Kings, Balon Greyjoy declared the Iron Islands' independence and raided the North while the Stark's army was fighting in the south. Having remained relatively uninvolved ever since, the ironborn's massive fleet remains at full strength, a fact lost on the major powers of the mainland, who have been nearly exhausted fighting each other. All of this changes with the sudden return of Balon's exiled younger brother Euron Greyjoy - cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and more than a little insane, he strikes fear even into the other ironborn. He pushes for the ironborn to launch massive new offensives against the other kingdoms, not simply to raid, but to hold and conquer territory, as Euron's ultimate ambition is nothing less than to conquer all of the Seven Kingdoms. He is opposed by Balon's daughter Yara Greyjoy, who urges that the Iron Islands must preserve their strength and engage in diplomacy with the mainland if they are to survive. And as the winds of winter begin to sweep through the south, far Beyond the Wall the young Bran Stark has been staying with the last of the Children of the Forest and his new mentor, the Three-eyed raven, in order to hone his abilities. Bran will not walk again, but he has learned to fly.				2015-07-19 23:57:20.373000000

In a distant part of the galaxy lie The Twelve Colonies of Man, a civilization that has been at peace for some forty years with an empire of machines, the Cylons, who were created generations before as worker drones for mankind, but became independent, rose in rebellion, and launched war on their masters. Now, the Cylons have evolved into more human form, into machine-created biological beings, who seek to exterminate true biological humans. To this end they use a human scientist, Gaius, to help one of their infiltrators, known as #6, penetrate the Colonies' master defense mainframes; Gaius is reluctant but smitten by #6, a Cylon woman of seemingly insatiable sexual desire, and the result of their affair is a nuclear sneak-attack that obliterates the Colonies and the star navy deployed for their protection. One ship, however, survives, an obsolete battlestar known as the Galactica; scheduled for decommissioning, the Galactica instead must lead 50,000 surviving humans on a quest for a new home world, where they must bear children to rebuild their race. First, however, the Galactica must lead surviving ships of the Colonies to a weapons deployment base within a spatial storm, a rendezvous that leaves them trapped when two Cylon base stars track them down and open fire.

In a distant part of the galaxy lie The Twelve Colonies of Man, a civilization that has been at peace for some forty years with an empire of machines, the Cylons, who were created generations before as worker drones for mankind, but became independent, rose in rebellion, and launched war on their masters. Now, the Cylons have evolved into more human form, into machine-created biological beings, who seek to exterminate true biological humans. To this end they use a human scientist, Gaius, to help one of their infiltrators, known as #6, penetrate the Colonies' master defense mainframes; Gaius is reluctant but smitten by #6, a Cylon woman of seemingly insatiable sexual desire, and the result of their affair is a nuclear sneak-attack that obliterates the Colonies and the star navy deployed for their protection. One ship, however, survives, an obsolete battlestar known as the Galactica; scheduled for decommissioning, the Galactica instead must lead 50,000 surviving humans on a quest for a new home world, where they must bear children to rebuild their race. First, however, the Galactica must lead surviving ships of the Colonies to a weapons deployment base within a spatial storm, a rendezvous that leaves them trapped when two Cylon base stars track them down and open fire.

Only Tory goes, while the remaining three are suddenly drawn to Kara's Viper by the music. The route to Earth is finally found.	Having accomplished its mission, the rebel Cylon Basestar joins the Colonial fleet. D'Anna Biers distrusts their former enemies and makes it quite clear that she will execute President Roslin and all of the other hostages from the Colonial fleet unless the four of the Final 5 in the fleet are allowed to leave and go to the Basestar. Acting President Lee Adama realizes that if he lets the four go to the rebel ship, nothing will prevent D'Anna from simply jumping away and leaving them behind. A tense stand-off ensues with both sides threatening to destroy the other with their nukes. Tory Foster goes to the Basestar on the pretense of taking Roslin her medication. Saul Tigh finally tells the Admiral the truth and soon the other two are known. Starbuck meanwhile notices an anomaly in the navigation system of the pristine Viper she brought back to the ship. She believes it is a signal from Earth.				2015-06-09 00:38:08.390000000

Against Marge's wishes, the family stays up for a movie adaptation of "Noah's Ark," which turns out to be a very long (and bombastic) Troy McClure adaptation. The movie runs all night, and a very tired Bart and Lisa head off to school while Homer calls in sick, claiming that his family came down with smallpox. At school, Bart and Lisa are participating in a Model United Nations Club meeting (which doesn't go very well) before leaving for an excursion. During the trip, the children's antics cause an accident; Otto was trying to brake to avoid a steep hill, and when he finally is able to slam on the brakes, the juice from a grapefruit (which had been lodged beneath the brake pedal) squirts into Otto's eyes, blinding him and causing him to steer the bus off a high suspension bridge. The bridge plunges into a river. Otto swims away "for help," but is swept away by a tidal wave; he is later rescued by Chinese fishermen. The schoolchildren, meanwhile, escape the bus and are washed ashore on a desert island. There, Bart puts up his bravado and insists that survival on a desert island is just like on television, but harsh reality sets in and the children soon realize they have no survivalist skills. Eventually, Bart is able to secure a cooler full of snack food items left in the bus; the hungry children chow down, but Lisa demands they ration the food (since it could be days before they are rescued). However, everyone awakens the next morning to discover the rations are gone and - due to circumstantial evidence - immediately suspect Milhouse. A trial is immediately held, where Milhouse insists a monster was to blame. Without evidence to confirm his other classmates' suspicions, Bart acquits Milhouse, making everyone else (except for Lisa) very angry. The others chase after the three and they corner them in a cave ... where the monster - which turns out to be a wild boar - lurks. On one of its tusks is an empty bag of potato chips, which immediately lets Milhouse off the hook. The children later kill the boar and eat it; Lisa, since she is a vegetarian, forces herself to eat the slime that was the boar's food source. At the end, a narrator (James Earl Jones) says the children are eventually rescued ... "by, let's say, Moe." In the subplot, Ned Flanders' mail gets mixed in with the Simpsons, and one of the letters is for "Flandcrest Enterprises," which turns out to be an Internet business Ned and Maude have started (they sell religious book rugs). Homer sees profit potential and decides to start his own online business, Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net. His first customer is Comic Book Guy ... and the only one, as it turns out, since Bill Gates and two goons immediately "buy out" Homer by trashing his entire living room!

Ned Flanders shows off his newly purchased (and monstrous) motor home to the Simpsons. In a fit of oneupmanship, Homer decides he needs one too. Homer's credit is very poor, but he wants that motor home, so he buys one whose oil is leaking and appears to be held together by chicken wire and duct tape. With their new motor home, Homer takes the family on an outing in the woods. Homer quickly loses his way and everyone bails from the motor home just before it tumbles into a large ravine. The family is forced to rough it the rest of the way. Maggie becomes separated from the family and takes refuge with a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart lose their clothing and have to wear leaves. Homer quickly falls into a stream and becomes covered with mud. A couple staying in the woods, concluding that what they've seen is Bigfoot, takes a picture of Homer and sends it to a TV station. Soon, the woods are crawling with media representatives, hoping to get their own glimpse. A park ranger shoots Homer with a tranquilizer and he is taken to a laboratory for analysis. However, the results - either it's a below-average human or a brilliant beast, a German scientist says - are inconclusive.	English	USA		2015-08-04 00:32:42.413000000

Naptime at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is rudely interrupted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is conducting a surprise inspection and employee audit. Homer's skills are tested and not only is he found to be incompetent, he causes a nuclear meltdown! The NRC inspectors demand that Homer (who is found to lack proper certification) either take college courses to obtain the necessary credentials or else Mr. Burns will face criminal charges. Burns gets Homer enrolled at Springfield University, where he acts like an immature adolescent (both in class and around campus) rather than someone needing to study for a college degree. When he continues to act like a know-it-all in physics class, the professor has enough and asks him to demonstrate a proton accelerator; Homer winds up causing another meltdown. Homer is asked to hire a tutor, and does: nerds Benjamin, Gary and Doug. Instead of applying himself, Homer sees the three nerds have no social life and decides to teach them how to party. He masterminds a practical joke with rival Springfield A&M University's college mascot, Sir Oinks-a-Lot, but things backfire and the nerds are expelled. Homer feels bad and allows them to move into his house, but the nerds quickly disrupt the family routine. Marge demands that the nerds need to go, so Homer decides to get them re-enrolled by having the nerds save the dean's life by pushing him out of the way of Homer's car. However, the plan fails and the dean will now need hip replacement surgery. At the hospital, Homer admits his recent schemes, and the dean (who for some reason is not upset at all) allows the nerds to re-enroll. With the final exam fast approaching, Benjamin, Gary and Doug have no choice but to force Homer to cram. However, Homer still fails his exam ... or does he? Homer tries to get the nerds to hack into the college computer mainframe and change his grade, but Marge puts a stop to it and orders him to re-take the course ... alas, it only gives Homer more time to party!
